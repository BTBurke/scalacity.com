                <em>How does it work?</em>
                <br><br>
                Define your application's architecture, its configuration, and dependencies in a simple text-based format.  We'll automatically analyze your application and your custom scaling rules to determine how best to deploy your code to your cloud provider.  Scalacity integrates with your existing data stores and cloud architecture to launch, provision, and monitor your application.
                <br><br>
                Deploy Storm, Spark, or Hadoop applications easily without worrying about configuration headaches.  Or, develop your own application framework with fine-grained control over all aspects of your configuration.  Start from our battle-tested Puppet configurations and fine-tune them as needed.

                <br><br>
                Visualize every important metric in your application.  Quickly identify bottlenecks created by machine capacity, the network, or define custom application metrics to understand where your code is slow.  Our web interface allows you to drill down so you can see when things aren't working and why.  
                <br><br>
                Your metrics and logs are fully indexed and searchable via the web interface or through our API.  Run different versions of your application and compare performance metrics, or go back in time and see how and why your application's performance has changed.
